//Vector: a vector includes magnitude and a direction. 
// example: what is the vector of A?
// Answer: 15 degree magnitude horizontally at 12 meters/second. A is also then a velocity vector.

//supervise learning
//Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
//Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.
//
//

//unsupervise learning: Algorithms are left to their own devises to discover and present the interesting structure in the data.
// when there is no output "y" and only f(x) 
// Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by 
// purchasing behavior.
// Association:  An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data,
// such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y
//EXAMPLES
//k-means for clustering problems.
//Apriori algorithm for association rule learning problems


// semi supervise learning: large input of x and only some output of y.
//example is a photo archive where only some of the images are labeled, (e.g. dog, cat, person) and the majority are unlabeled.
